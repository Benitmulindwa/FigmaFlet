# FigmaFlet

FigmaFlet is a tool that generates Flet UI code directly from Figma designs. It streamlines the process of transforming your Figma prototypes into production-ready Python code using the Flet framework. Whether you're a designer, developer, or both, FigmaFlet helps bridge the gap between design and implementation.

## Features

- **Figma Integration**: Fetch designs directly from Figma using the file URL and API key.
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Generate Flet UI code from your designs with minimal manual effort.
- **Multi-line Text Handling**: Supports multi-line text elements seamlessly.
- **Extensible Components**: Supports custom components like Frames, Containers, Text, and more.
- **Graphical Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI for entering API keys, file URLs, and output paths.

## Usage

Launch the GUI to interactively input your API key, file URL, and output path:

```bash
python -m figmaflet.gui
```

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Once installed, use the CLI to generate Flet code:

```bash
figmaflet --apikey YOUR_API_KEY --fileurl YOUR_FILE_URL --output YOUR_OUTPUT_PATH
```



Requirements
Python >= 3.8
Dependencies:
Flet
Jinja2
Requests
Configuration

Figma API Key
You will need your Figma API key to access design files. Generate your key by visiting your Figma account settings.

File URL
Provide the Figma file URL containing your design. Ensure that the file is accessible using your API key.

### How It Works
Input your API key and file URL.
FigmaFlet fetches the design data using Figma's API.
The tool processes the design elements and generates Flet-compatible Python code.
The generated code is saved to your specified output path.
